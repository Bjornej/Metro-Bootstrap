# Metro Bootstrap #

A twitter bootstrap clone that aims to create a look and feel similar to that of a Metro UI application and to provide some components useful in a web app.


The basic idea is to create a style that can replace twitter bootstrap integrating itself with jQuery UI and provide some useful elements in a modern web app.

The style is built with Sass and the build system is based on Grunt
